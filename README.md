A JavaFX powered Library System

  The Library Database Manager is a JavaFX application designed to connect to a MySQL 9.2 database and manage a collection of books. The program allows users to view, add, update, and delete book records while dynamically displaying author names from the Authors table.
  The application ensures persistent connection and performs all operation accordingly. Users can easily navigate the interface, modify records, and refresh the data to stay up to date with any external changes made to the database.
